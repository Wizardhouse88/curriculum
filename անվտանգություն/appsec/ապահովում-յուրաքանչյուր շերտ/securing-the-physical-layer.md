# Securing the Physical Layer


---

## Content

A person gaining unauthorized access to a facility presents a myriad of vulnerabilities to the Physical Layer of its network. The trespasser could destroy/steal hardware or data, as well as set up discrete monitoring systems. This can be mitigated with an **access control system**, such as electronic locks, PIN keypads, or security badges. This access control system should keep logs of who enters and leaves the facility and at what time. Audio and video surveillance of the facility and its perimeter would further prevent break-ins and identify the trespasser.

Not all Physical Layer vulnerabilities are caused by intruders, oblivious staff can present just as much a risk to a network. For example, a cleaning crew could accidentally pull a plug causing a critical Loss of Power or damage to hardware. Problems like this can be mitigated by informing staff what they should avoid tampering with, or having multiple levels of clearance in the access control system, restricting sensitive locations to technical staff members.
